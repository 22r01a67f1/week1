While working on Git, we actively use two repositories.

•	(Git)Local repository: The local repository is present on our computer and consists of all the files and folders. This Repository is used to make changes locally, review history, and commit when offline.
•	(GitHub)Remote repository: The remote repository refers to the server repository that may be present anywhere. This repository is used by all the team members to exchange the changes made.
Both repositories have their own set of commands. There are separate Git Commands that work on different types of repositories.
